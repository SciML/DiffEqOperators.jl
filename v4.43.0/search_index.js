The cases of 1, 2, and 3 dimensions with an evenly spaced grid are optimized with a convolution routine from NNlib.jl. Care is taken to give efficiency by avoiding unnecessary allocations, using purpose-built stencil compilers, allowing GPUs and parallelism, etc. Any operator can be concretized as an Array, a BandedMatrix or a sparse matrix.","category":"page"},{"location":"operators/jacobian_vector_product/#Jacobian-Vector-Product-Operators","page":"Jacobian-Vector Product Operators","title":"Jacobian-Vector Product Operators","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"operators/jacobian_vector_product/","page":"Jacobian-Vector Product Operators","title":"Jacobian-Vector Product Operators","text":"JacVecOperator{T}(f,u::AbstractArray,p=nothing,t::Union{Nothing,Number}=nothing;autodiff=true,ishermitian=false,opnorm=true)","category":"page"},{"location":"operators/jacobian_vector_product/","page":"Jacobian-Vector Product Operators","title":"Jacobian-Vector Product Operators","text":"The JacVecOperator is a linear operator J*v where J acts like df/du for some function f(u,p,t).
