    calculate_weights(n::Int, x₀::Real, x::Vector)

Return a vector `c` such that `c⋅f.(x)` approximates ``f^{(n)}(x₀)`` for a smooth `f`.

The points `x` need not be evenly spaced.

The stencil `c` has the highest approximation order possible given values of `f` at `length(x)` points. More precisely, if `x` has length `m`, there is a function `g` such that ``g(y) = f(y) + O(y-x₀)^{m-n+?}`` and ``c⋅f.(x) = g'(x₀)``.

The algorithm is due to [Fornberg](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-1988-0935077-0), with a [modification](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0036144596322507) to improve stability.

    DerivativeOperator{T<:Real,N,Wind,T2,S1,S2<:SVector,T3,F}(<fields>)

Represent a finite-difference derivative operator.

These operators implement the `SciMLBase.AbstractDiffEqLinearOperator` interface. Therefore, `eltype` returns `T`.

These operators can be contracted over an arbitrary dimension, given by the type parameter `N`.

The `CentredDifference` and `UpwindDifference` types serve as hooks to hang constructors, but no objects are actually constructed with those types. Their constructors return structures of type `DerivativeOperator`, with stencils constructed by `calculate_weights`, and other fields filled out appropriately.

The finite-difference methods are defined for `DerivativeOperator`. In particular, `*`, which actually takes derivatives.

The key data are three stencils of coefficients, stored in `SVector`s. The interior stencil, stored in `stencil_coefs::S1`, is the normal one used in the interior of the grid. The others, `low_boundary_coefs::S2` and `high_boundary_coefs::S2`, are used where the normal stencil would jut out of the grid boundary. These can have a different length than the interior stencil, hence the two types.

When the operator is applied by `mul!`, these stencils are multiplied by the vector in the `coefficients` field. It is set to `coeff_func.(1:len)` in `UpwindDifference`, which seems odd, because `len` is not the stencil length. Scalar multiplication is absorbed into this vector, as required by the `SciMLBase.AbstractDiffEqLinearOperator` interface.

The `coefficients` field appears to be a more general `DifferentialEquations` thing. There is an `update_coefficients!` method.

The term “left boundary” is used interchangeably with “low boundary”, and “right” with “high”.

# Type Parameters

Presumably, most of these are to force method specialization on:a) the stencil lengths, which are given by the parameters of the `SVector` types `S1` and `S2`, and b) even or arbitrary grid spacing.

- `T<:Real`: Function range type.
- `N`: Contraction dimension.
- `Wind`: Flag `true` for upwind operators, `false` for centered.
- `T2`: Concrete type of `dx` field, which might be `T` or `AbstractVector{T}`.
- `S1`: Concrete type of the interior stencil. (When is this not an `SVector`?)
- `S2<:SVector`: Concrete type of boundary coefficients.
- `T3`: `Vector{T}` if a `coeff_func` was supplied, `Nothing` otherwise.
- `F`: `typeof(coeff_func)` if a `coeff_func` was supplied, `Nothing` otherwise.

# Fields

- `derivative_order::Int`: The `n` in `f⁽ⁿ⁾(x)`.
- `approximation_order::Int`: The degree of polynomial for which the operator is numerically exact.
- `dx::T2`: Grid step.
- `len::Int`: The number of interior points on the grid.
- `stencil_length::Int`: Length of the interior stencil.
- `stencil_coefs::S1`: An `SVector` of the interior stencil coefficients.
- `boundary_stencil_length::Int`:
- `boundary_point_count::Int`:
- `low_boundary_coefs::S2`: An array of `SVector` stencils for the interior points where `stencil_coefs` juts over the left boundary.
- `high_boundary_coefs::S2`: An array of `SVector` stencils for the interior points where `stencil_coefs` juts over the right boundary.
- `coefficients::T3`: Multiplier for the stencil.
- `coeff_func::F`: God only knows what this function is for.

    abstract type AbstractBC{T}

`T` is the range type of the discretized function.

Boundary condition operators extrapolate the discretized function
as illustrated in the README, adding a ghost node at each end such
that an interpolated polynomial satisfies the boundary condition.

Some of these are affine operators with a constant term, not linear
operators, so using `*` and `\\` is a minor abuse of notation. For example,
when there is a non-zero Dirichlet boundary value, the value at the
ghost node is constant, and does not scale proportional to the
interior function values. Because boundary condition operators are
not linear, they can not be concretized as matrices.

`GhostDerivativeOperator` somehow concretizes as a pair of matrices.

The implementation of `*(::AffineBC, ::Vector)` returns a
`BoundaryPaddedVector`. This is a structure that stores the ghost
values separately from the original vector. Presumably, this is to
avoid allocations, although the `mul!` method for `GhostDerivativeOperator`
and `Matrix` method allocates a new `BoundaryPaddedArray` for each
column.

In higher-dimensional cases, it might return a
`BoundaryPaddedArray`.

The `*` operator for a derivative multiplying a boundary condition
packages them up as a `GhostDerivativeOperator`. This cannot
return a sparse matrix, because the operator is affine (not linear).
When a vector is multiplied by one of those, it uses `*(::AbstractBC,
::AbstractVector)` to pad with ghost nodes, then
`mul!(::DerivativeOperator, ::AbstractVector)` evaluates the
derivative.

Creates a periodic boundary condition, where the lower index end of some u is extended
with the upper index end and vice versa. It is not recommended to concretize this BC
type in to a BandedMatrix, since the vast majority of bands will be all 0s.
SparseMatrix concretization is recommended.

Currently, periodic boundary conditions are only implemented in one
dimension.

    q = RobinBC(l, r, dx::Vector{T}, approximation_order) where T # When this BC extends a dimension with a non-uniform step size. dx should be the vector of step sizes for the whole dimension.

`l` and `r` are the BC coefficients, i.e., `(αl, βl, γl)` and `(αl, βl, γl)` (tuples and vectors work)

`αl * u + βl * u' = γl`
`αr * u + βr * u' = γr`

`RobinBC` implements a Robin boundary condition operator `Q` that acts on a vector to give an extended
vector as a result (see https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqOperators.jl/files/3267835/ghost_node.pdf).

Write vector b̄₁ as a vertical concatenation with b0 and the rest of the elements of b̄₁, denoted b̄`₁, the same with ū into u0 and ū`. b̄`₁ = b̄`_2 = fill(β/Δx, length(stencil)-1).
Pull out the product of u0 and b0 from the dot product. The stencil used to approximate u` is denoted s. b0 = α+(β/Δx)*s[1].
Rearrange terms to find a general formula for u0:= -b̄`₁̇⋅ū`/b0 + γ/b0, which is dependent on ū` the robin coefficients and Δx.
The non-identity part of Qa is qa:= -b`₁/b0 = -β.*s[2:end]/(α+β*s[1]/Δx). The constant part is Qb = γ/(α+β*s[1]/Δx)
