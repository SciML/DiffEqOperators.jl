# # Heat Equation
#
# This example demonstrates how to combine `OrdinaryDiffEq` with `DiffEqOperators` to solve a time-dependent PDE.
# We consider the heat equation on the unit interval, with Dirichlet boundary conditions:
# ∂ₜu = Δu
# u(x=0,t)  = a
# u(x=1,t)  = b
# u(x, t=0) = u₀(x)
#
# For `a = b = 0` and `u₀(x) = sin(2πx)` a solution is given by:
u_analytic(x, t) = sin(2 * π * x) * exp(-t * (2 * π)^2)
#
# We want to reproduce it numerically
#
