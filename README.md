DiffEqOperators.jl is a package for finite difference discretization of partial
differential equations. It serves two purposes:

1. Building fast lazy operators for high order non-uniform finite differences.
2. Automated finite difference discretization of symbolically-defined PDEs.


#### Note: (2) is still a work in progress!

For the operators, both centered and
[upwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwind_scheme) operators are provided,
for domains of any dimension, arbitrarily spaced grids, and for any order of accuracy.
The cases of 1, 2, and 3 dimensions with an evenly spaced grid are optimized with a
convolution routine from `NNlib.jl`. Care is taken to give efficiency by avoiding
unnecessary allocations, using purpose-built stencil compilers, allowing GPUs
and parallelism, etc. Any operator can be concretized as an `Array`, a
`BandedMatrix` or a sparse matrix.

## Documentation

For information on using the package,
[see the stable documentation](https://diffeqoperators.sciml.ai/stable/). Use the
[in-development documentation](https://diffeqoperators.sciml.ai/dev/) for the version of
the documentation which contains the unreleased features.

## Example 1: Automated Finite Difference Solution to the Heat Equation

```julia
using OrdinaryDiffEq, ModelingToolkit, DiffEqOperators, DomainSets

# Parameters, variables, and derivatives
@parameters t x
@variables u(..)
Dt = Differential(t)
Dxx = Differential(x)^2

# 1D PDE and boundary conditions
eq  = Dt(u(t,x)) ~ Dxx(u(t,x))
bcs = [u(0,x) ~ cos(x),
       u(t,0) ~ exp(-t),
       u(t,Float64(pi)) ~ -exp(-t)]

# Space and time domains
domains = [t ∈ Interval(0.0,1.0),
           x ∈ Interval(0.0,Float64(pi))]

# PDE system
@named pdesys = PDESystem(eq,bcs,domains,[t,x],[u(t,x)])

# Method of lines discretization
dx = 0.1
order = 2
discretization = MOLFiniteDifference([x=>dx],t;centered_order=order)

# Convert the PDE problem into an ODE problem
prob = discretize(pdesys,discretization)

# Solve ODE problem
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),saveat=0.1)
```

## Example 2: Finite Difference Operator Solution for the Heat Equation

```julia
using DiffEqOperators, OrdinaryDiffEq

# # Heat Equation
# This example demonstrates how to combine `OrdinaryDiffEq` with `DiffEqOperators` to solve a time-dependent PDE.
# We consider the heat equation on the unit interval, with Dirichlet boundary conditions:
# ∂ₜu = Δu
# u(x=0,t)  = a
# u(x=1,t)  = b
# u(x, t=0) = u₀(x)
#
# For `a = b = 0` and `u₀(x) = sin(2πx)` a solution is given by:
u_analytic(x, t) = sin(2*π*x) * exp(-t*(2*π)^2)

nknots = 100
h = 1.0/(nknots+1)
knots = range(h, step=h, length=nknots)
ord_deriv = 2
ord_approx = 2

const Δ = CenteredDifference(ord_deriv, ord_approx, h, nknots)
const bc = Dirichlet0BC(Float64)

t0 = 0.0
t1 = 0.03
u0 = u_analytic.(knots, t0)

step(u,p,t) = Δ*bc*u
prob = ODEProblem(step, u0, (t0, t1))
alg = KenCarp4()
sol = solve(prob, alg)
```
